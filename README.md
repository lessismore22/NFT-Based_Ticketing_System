This project proposes the development of an NFT-based ticketing system on the Near Protocol.
The system aims to revolutionize the ticketing industry by offering enhanced security,
transparency, and fan engagement. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology, the
system will address the challenges of traditional ticketing methods, such as fraud, counterfeit
tickets, and lack of transparency.
